			<h3> My Journey so far</h3>
			<p>You are welcome to my personal story page. Let me introduce myself properly.</p>
			<p>My name is Adewumi. I currently teach computing in a school in Lekki. Yeah I'm a teacher. Well not just as a job but professionally because I graduated with <em>Bsc(Edu)</em> from TASUED. I have worked in schools till date mostly as an educator but I'm most interested in design and software and that's the reason I signed up for SGA even though I'm not a fresh grad lol. By the way, I have been introduced to web technologies since 2010; Vb 6, C#, html.</p>
			<h4><strong>To get a tech role, I'm aware I need to brush up and thank God we could take advantage of the work from home to run some courses!</strong></h4>
