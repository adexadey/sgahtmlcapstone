			<h2> My Journey so far</h2>
			<p>You are welcome to my personal story page. Let me introduce myself properly.</p>
      <p>My name is <strong>Adewumi</strong>. I currently teach computing in a school in Lekki. Yeah I'm a teacher. Well not just as a job but professionally because I graduated with <strong><em>Bsc(Edu)</em></strong> from TASUED. I have worked in schools till date mostly as an educator but I'm most interested in design and software and that's the reason I signed up for SGA even though I'm not a fresh grad lol. By the way, I have been introduced to web technologies since 2010; Vb 6, C#, html.</p>
      <p>To get a tech role, I'm aware I need to <strong>brush up</strong> and thank God we could take advantage of the <strong>work from home</strong> to run some <strong>courses!</strong></p>
